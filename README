HsExpand aims to be an interpreter for a small, educationally useful
subset of Haskell98, that prints out the internal representation of
the code in a human-readable manner after each "step" of evaluating
it. Currently a step doesn't have a set definition.

It uses and requires the haskell-src package for parsing and code
representation.
